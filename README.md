*Your week is here.*

Hot Lecture Digest is a program that consists of two core parts. One is the 'speech-to-text' tool that coverts Kingos' lecture into script, and the other is an administration tool with GUI which organizes your school-week. Hot Lecture Digest will be an ultimate weapon for Kingos to manage school works in these difficult days due to the pandemic.

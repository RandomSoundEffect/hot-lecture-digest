*Your week is here.*

Hot Lecture Digest is a program that consists of two core parts. One is the 'speech-to-text' tool that coverts Kingos' lecture into script, and the other is an administration tool with GUI which organizes your school-week. Hot Lecture Digest will be an ultimate weapon for Kingos to manage school works in these difficult days due to the pandemic.

## **How to contribute**

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### **We Develop with Github**

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### **We Use¬†[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests**

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use¬†[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from¬†`master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### **Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License**

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same¬†[MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)¬†that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### **Report bugs using Github's¬†[issues](https://github.com/OSSP-group-5/hot-lecture-digest/issues)**

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by¬†[opening a new issue](https://github.com/OSSP-group-5/hot-lecture-digest/issues); it's that easy!

### **Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code**

[This is an example](https://github.com/OSSP-group-5/hot-lecture-digest/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)¬†of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's¬†[another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports**¬†tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People¬†*love*¬†thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

### **Use a Consistent Coding Style**

I'm again borrowing these from¬†[Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can use .editorconfig and .prettierrc for consistent styling

and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This

sustained inappropriate behavior.
